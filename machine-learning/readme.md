Machine Learning dev environment

use `docker-compose build` to build the image
use `terraform apply` to mount the built image

One tool is usually better than two.
I used terraform because my work uses it and I wanted an excuse to learn parts of it.
I used docker-compose to build the image because I prefer simple commands I can remember to commands I have to copy from a file.

All of this could have been done using docker-compose.
