## Part 1. 60 Marks; 5 Marks each - each answer **should include about 150 words.**

1.  Define the concepts “interrupt” and “trap”, and explain the purpose of an interrupt vector.
5/5

2. How does a computer system with von Neumann architecture execute an instruction?
3/5

    > Your answer is quite brief considering the expected answer length at the start of this assignment. I don't sit here counting words, but I do look for a complete answer that demonstrates your understanding, and the suggested length is a guide. In addition, the exam marker (I don’t mark exams) considers this to be very important!
    > When your answer is too brief, consider adding other, relevant information. Here, for example, you could discuss the role of the program counter and other registers, internal CPU activity, etc.

3. What role do device controllers and device drivers play in a computer system?
5/5

4. Why do clustered systems provide what is considered high-availability service?
5/5

5.  Describe an operating system's two modes of operation.
5/5

6.  Define “cache” and explain cache coherency.
5/5

7. Describe why direct memory access (DMA) is considered an efficient mechanism for performing I/O.
4/5

    > Again, somewhat brief. Perhaps you could add detail to your description of non-DMA data transfer.

8. Describe why multicore processing is more efficient than placing each processor on its own chip.
5/5

9.  Describe the relationship between an API, the system-call interface, and the operating system.
5/5

10.  Describe some requirements and goals to consider when designing an operating system.
5/5

11.  Explain why a modular kernel may be the best of the current operating system design techniques.
5/5

12. Distinguish between virtualization and simulation.
5/5

## Part 2. 40 Marks; each answer should include one or two pages.

1. Draw a typical computer organization figure that includes the main components of von Neumann architecture. Identify each component, and explain its function and interaction relative to other components.
15/15

2. Define system call, and list the main types of system calls. Elaborate on how a system call interacts with a standard C library and hardware under a dual-mode operating system environment.
10/10

    > Wow! Excellent!!

3. Describe the overall structure of virtual machines, and compare VMware and JVM.
15/15

> Excellent!

Total:    97/100
