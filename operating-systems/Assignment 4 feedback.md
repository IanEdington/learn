## Part 2: Research Project

> Excellent paper!
> In general, the paper is well-written and well-researched.
> However, the paper needs more depth of analysis. One key idea you presented was the list of criteria for establishment of root of trust (pg. 8). This set of criteria should be used to fully measure the quality of the solution you proposed. A discussion of performance (even if only in general terms) would also be very relevant here.
> Your conclusion should be tightened up and shortened. E.g., where you introduce secure deletion, that concept should have been covered in the body of the paper.
> Nonetheless, this is excellent work.
