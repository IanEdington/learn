##### Barriers of implementing a Trusted Computing Platform in a Public Cloud Environment

In recent years there has been a shift in enterprise computing platforms away from private data centers to cloud providers.
A cloud provider is a company that provides a data center that hosts virtual machines from many companies.
Because of the economies of scale these providers are better able to utilize system resources.
This shift has brought with it flexibility, reduced cost, and in general better security, but it has also introduced a security concern that was non existent in private data centers.
In a private data center a company controls everything including the physical security, the hardware, the operating system, all the way up to the applications running on that system.
However, In a cloud environment the company doesn't control the physical security, the hardware or the Virtual Machine Manager(VMM).

Although working with a trusted cloud provider is sufficient in most cases, having assurances of control is necessary for certain applications, especially in the finance, healthcare, and public sectors.
Two types of security assurances are required in order to confirm the integrity of a system.
Accreditation of the physical, hardware, and software solutions through third party audits, and software assurances that an application is running on the platform it is expected to run on.
Accreditation of systems has largely been solved, but the challenge of an untrusted system to prove it's trustworthiness is still unsolved.

This paper will explore the technical challenges for VMM in cloud providers and virtual machine operating systems, in providing a trusted platform.
