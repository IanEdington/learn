# What to learn
https://teachyourselfcs.com/

## Topics
- Computer Architecture
    - If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.
    - Computer Organization and Design
    - Berkeley CS 61C

- Languages and Compilers
    - If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you’ll write better code and learn new languages more easily.
    - Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools
    - Alex Aiken’s course on Lagunita

- Programming
    - Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming (MIT Press) 1st Edition Edition
    - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
    - Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion.

- Math for CS
    - CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.
    - Mathematics for Computer Science
    - Tom Leighton’s MIT 6.042J


- Algorithms and Data Structures
    - **The Algorithm Design Manual**
    - **How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method**
    - If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve hard problems.
    - Steven Skiena’s lectures

- Operating Systems
    - Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.
    - Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces
    - Berkeley CS 162

- Computer Networking
    - The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential.
    - Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach
    - Stanford CS 144

- Databases
    - Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work.
    - Readings in Database Systems
    - Joe Hellerstein’s Berkeley CS 186

- Concurrent and Parallel Programming

- Distributed Systems
    - These days, most systems are distributed systems.
    - Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms

- Software Testing and Quality Assurance
